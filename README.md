# SubwaySandwichGenerator
A small Python script that generates a random sandwich configuration from Subway.

I created this script around July of 2019. At the time, I was staying in a small town in rural Canada where the only place to eat in the entire town was just a Subway.
Anticipating the boredom of eating the same thing for every meal, every single day, I wrote a script that would make things a little bit more interesting.
I organized the information I could find on the Subway online menu, and created a Python script that randomly generates a sandwich that you can order in-store.

Note that the program is static, and that information drawn for the program may at any point in the future become out of date (ie. a certain ingredient is no longer offered). It's possible that in the future I may recreate this with a bit more versatility, such as more user options and automatic ingredient updates based off of the Subway website or something like that.

Disclaimer: I can't guarantee that any of these combinations will be any good. Please try this at your own risk.
