# SubwaySandwichGenerator
A small Python script that generates a random sandwich configuration from Subway.

I created this script around July of 2019. At the time, I was staying in a small town in rural Canada where the only place to eat in the entire town was just a Subway.
Anticipating the boredom of eating the same thing for every meal, every single day, I wrote a script that would make things a little bit more interesting.
I organized the information I could find on the Subway online menu, and created a Python script that randomly generates a sandwich that you can order in-store.
